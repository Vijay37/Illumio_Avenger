Illumio Coding Assignment 2017-2018, PCE team (Avenger)


Introduction
This project is a coding assignment given to me by Illumio. It is a simplified model of Illumio's host based firewall product programmed to block or accept a packet based on predetermined set of rules. These set of rules are entered in a csv file and fed to the program.


Project Summary
1. I have spent around 15 mins prior to code on documenting the deliverables, assumptions and algorithm. 
2. These details can be found in the folder called files :
Documentation file path: files/documentation.pdf
3. Later it took me close to one hour to implement the code and test various test cases
4. I have created a data file called illumio_data.csv (Can be found in files folder) with dataset of 700 entries

How to use?
1. Download the github repository
2. Use Illumio_Main.java as a main class
3. Firewall.java class implements the firewall functionality
4. Mention the csv file path in the mail class
5. Use run_test_cases function to execute the test cases.
6. Custom test cases can be added to the above function.
